        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/35hz/ -&lt;p&gt;He’s calling his girlfriend and she wants a new plastic face. People need to believe they’re better than others in some way, no matter how trivial, to keep going; myself included. But I have to be in this conversation, nominally, because we share the same blood, however distant. At least, that’s what my mother insists. The other relative—a cousin, I think—sits right next to him and scrolls through her phone as dinner is laid out before her. She speaks TikTok Japanese: the verbal equivalent of diarrhea. The father of the two asks too many questions about the future, so I lie to entertain myself. It’s what you have to do with people like him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You got a girlfriend, Haru?” he asks with a slappable smirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, but I do sleep around quite a bit. A new girl every time,” I say with an inscrutable expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve reached that age huh? Don’t overdo it!” he says with a chuckle. “Make any new friends? New opportunities? Yeah, what’s new with you? How about the new—”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he goes on like this for quite some time, so I let go. He’s stupid, I think, but I’m unsure whether that’s true or if I believe it simply because I want an exit: an excuse to disengage. It’s rude, and it’s something I look for in almost every conversation, so, naturally, I doubt my judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I eat enough to last until midnight and retreat from the scene, back into the room I’ve decided to occupy for the rest of my time at home. I shut the door behind me and read until the sky turns dark—or rather, until the noise downstairs fades and people return to their dreams, where I don’t have to exert myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I descend into the dining room, swallowed by the dark. I’m hungry, yet I can’t help but stand in the midst of everything, sinking into the ground as each beat of my heart pulls me down. In the overwhelming silence, I hear nothing but the stern ticking of my watch—a pinnacle of mechanical precision: 3.5 Hz, give or take a couple seconds per day. Consistency at its finest. The moment is beautiful, and I recognize this, so my heart softens, and suddenly it’s a warm spring night when it’s not too humid—after a bath, standing on the balcony, ice cream in one hand as the fragrant air lifts my hair, twinkling city lights far away; a perfect equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I make my way to the fridge and swallow enough food to eventually excrete. The hour calls me to bed so I return and pass the time that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning—early, to avoid people—I decide to take a walk. As I exit the house, my mother, who woke at the sound of my footsteps, calls out to me: &lt;em&gt;come back by ten, we’re visiting Shunji’s family&lt;/em&gt;. I have no intention of coming back by that time. I don’t like lying, though I’ve learned to let go and give people what they want (it’s a drag otherwise), so I tell her I’ll be back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old people who belong to the park always feed the cats. The cats know that they’re coming at this time, so they congregate in the park and leave once they’re full. The most apathetic cats always win at everything. After feeding them, the old people stretch to the radio as I watch from afar. Their movements are languid, calculated, and silent, like parts of some larger machine. They might be working toward something, a collective movement to achieve a common goal, but I find this implausible, so I dismiss the idea. I figure they’re just passing time outside the grave, like the wavering shadows they are. I wonder if they know each other from decades past, but they’re probably all new. God knows how many iterations of people they’ve spent. I don’t like thinking, so I leave the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk toward my old high school through cracked streets and encounter an old acquaintance. I last saw her at graduation, said goodbye, well aware I’d never see her again. She’s done something to her face and hair—even her clothes. It’s unfamiliar and unwelcoming, but people probably call her prettier than before, or so I assume. Her features are placed in roughly the right places; they’re proportional. I observe that she is prettier, though I feel nothing. Her adorned nails seem longer than before, and she smells sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s eager upon meeting me, so I try to keep apace, even though my cheeks hurt. She asks me where I’m headed, so I tell her. Unfortunately, she decides to come along, as diplomacy doesn’t permit telling someone to get lost. As we walk, she’s complaining about something, and I feed passive replies—the expressive equivalent of a grunt. We eventually reach the campus, roaming about the school garden by the music building, and I’m thrown helplessly into forced nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when Shunji and I walked through the gardens at night, we caressed the velvetleaf plants—leaves softer than cashmere. We’d walk along the stone paths lit by solar lamps for as long as we pleased (Shunji’s parents came home only in the morning). Dangerous things happened when he was alone, and unlike me, he was strong enough to say he was scared. I never told him, but he knew that I loved him more than anything, and he loved me too. So when he left for college—left for everything else—his presence began to fade; people like him are terrible at keeping in touch. It’s childish, but I can’t describe how much hurt I felt—how worthless and discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone is playing the piano in the music building. I know it’s the same piano, but I can’t help hearing something different, so I’m depressed, as if that would coax the person to stop. I’ve never felt dejected by anything with such intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl drivels on, and I respond with agreeable politeness. I’m disappointed, yet I’m the same. I yield to the despicable reminder of passing time, tearing people away with indifference as they desperately cling on in an attempt to convince me of their value. I’m too childish to see it. I’m merely a clump of instincts working to satisfy my own conscience. I’m afraid I seek nothing but the awareness of my virtue, rather than the embodiment of it, and if I fall into some lapse in sanity, I wouldn’t be strong or smart enough to observe my depravity. Guilt and regret are my only motivators. I’m a vile being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See—I need somebody to slap me out of it with all their might. I need somebody to tell me: &lt;em&gt;Look at me! Right now! I’m in front of you! Love me as I am! Love me with everything you have! Love me until you’ve become nothing but scraps, crawling on the ground with your teeth in the mud! Love me even if I slash you to bits and spit on your bloody face! Love me despite my rotten mess and give me a chance to ruin our lives! Love me through your tears, through betrayal, through derision! I want you more than anything and you’re all I’ve ever wanted!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Believe in me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, we can never demand such things, so we’re walking through the garden, and they’ve removed the velvetleaf plants; replaced them with chrysanths. The stone paths have been removed and replaced with concrete. In place of Shunji, walking by my side is this girl, now telling me that she likes poetry, or what she believes to be poetry. One day, after I’ve let go of everything, I’d probably marry someone like this, I think. Not that I’m attracted to people like her, but I’d be happy enough: consolation life. And I could fall in love if I let myself. I’d comfort her in her pains and relieve her of some burdens within a fortress of ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We exit the gardens, out of the gates of the school, and each go our separate ways. And as I walk past Shunji’s house, I see white hydrangeas by the doorstep. He never liked hydrangeas. I guess they didn’t bother asking his mother, assuming she even knew. I hear sirens wail in the distance; someone wants to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I return, the relative with the ephemeral girlfriend tells me &lt;em&gt;Happy birthday&lt;/em&gt;. Shunji’s death anniversary falls on the day I grow older and I feel I’ve done nothing to deserve such punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Debut as a Romance Novelist</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/romance/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/romance/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/romance/ -&lt;p&gt;I might as well die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, allow me to explain how I arrived at this conclusion, as I do not readily consider myself as the suicidal type. I confess that life treats me fairly well, and I have no immediate reason beyond the one I shall shortly provide; but bear with me, and I promise you will find yourself in the warmest realms of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crisis befell me on the nineteenth of October, the date of my birth. The day had started out just fine—in fact, I was in a good mood—when I awoke to find a blue paper bag resting on my table along with a note that read, Happy Birthday. At the thought of my roommate surreptitiously sneaking into my room late at night to leave the gift, I felt a certain warmth swelling within the crevices of my chest, as if warm milk had begun to leak from my heart. I arose from the bed, made my way to the desk, and peered into the bag, smiling in juvenile bliss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Ends With Us, Colleen Hoover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Starts With Us, Colleen Hoover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say, life is no longer worth living. Turns out, humanity is just another failed mutation, an evolutionary cul-de-sac: hopeless and far beyond salvation. There is no such thing as love, least of all among those who proclaim themselves the wiser societies—the sanctimonious nincompoops who scarcely deserve to breathe the same air. These are the thoughts that assail my depressed, wrinkled mind when faced with such vile forms of literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m a mere mortal. I cannot start a revolution to rid the world of this incomprehensible degree of hopelessness. This leaves me one final option: to conform to propriety. If I cannot divorce myself from this dejected landscape, I must become a part of it. Though it pains me to the depths of my heart and soul, I must continue this journey. To live is to conform and endure. Hence, this marks the beginning of my career as a romance novelist—and the birth of Colleen Hoover’s rival. I cannot end things here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scene 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny proceeds to makes some inappropriate move verging on sexual misconduct upon first meeting Destinee. He is bare-chested; he affects casual bravado. He pulls a freshly toasted baguette from his tote bag (god knows why he has a baguette), tucks it into the crook of his elbow, and pumps his French biceps, eliciting a resounding crackle from the crust. Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny smirks. Destinee is smitten.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESTINEE DESTINY-FOREVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cluchtes her tight chest, eyes sparkling.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my god! You’re the man of my dreams!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEAN-BAPTISTE–PIERRE-MARIE DE LA ROCHEFOUCALD-D’AUBIGNY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reveals that he’s a Vampire-Surgeon-Police-Officer-Werewolf, wearing a self-satisfied smirk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re the butter to my baguette—let’s spread the love. Je t’aime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESTINEE DESTINY-FOREVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yaaasssss!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny finishes his baguette in awkward silence while Destinee watches. He chokes on a piece and desperately reaches for the milk. Beads of the milk streak down his French cheeks. Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny smirks with his milk-stained lips. The two proceed to kiss deeply, described in at least fifty pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scene 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destinee and Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny are seen in the kitchen quarrelling over a triviality. In a fit of rage, Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny slips the crispiest baguette out of his bag and beats Destinee with it. With each strike, a loud crunch echoes though the kitchen. Destinee screams. Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny realizes the weight of his mistake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESTINEE DESTINY-FOREVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sobbing with delicious crumbs in her hair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are you doing this to me! I was sure I made the right choice by loving you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JEAN-BAPTISTE–PIERRE-MARIE DE LA ROCHEFOUCALD-D’AUBIGNY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His countenance betrays regret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je suis désolé. You’re the butter to my baguette, and I hate that I was the crumb on your day. Let me make it right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESTINEE DESTINY-FOREVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feeling slightly better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny finishes his bruised baguette, cramming it into his mouth and leaving crumbs across the tile. They decide to have pity sex lasting another fifty pages. A fragrant breeze carries the sweet smell of wheat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scene 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His Serene Highness Prince Octavius-Maximilian XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI, a childhood friend of Destinee, gallops in upon a high horse adorned with golden armour. He unfurls a scroll.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRINCE OCTAVIUS-MAXIMILIAN XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearest companion of impeccable taste, might you be amenable—purely as two fully consenting grown-ups of sound mind—to nearby realm of cushions for a civilised session of, well, in short—nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more—shall we enthusiastically and consensually engage in an evening of rah-rah rumpy, slap-and-tickle, snog-and-sconce, hanky-panky, and full-bodied British bedistry, after which we’ll toast our victory with a nice cuppa tea and perhaps some scones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESTINEE DESTINY-FOREVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wearing an expression of confusion and utter shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octavius??? Is that you??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRINCE OCTAVIUS-MAXIMILIAN XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, my beloved! ’Tis I, Prince Octavius-Maximilian XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI, witness to thy origins—the very man of thy dreams—upon whom it is laid to challenge thy present lover in an honourable duel, that a new bond be forged between thee and me, as is the trite romances such as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny and Prince Octavius-Maximilian XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI engage in a duel: baguette versus golden foil. Steel meets crust. Sparks. Crumbs. A cry. A parry. Silence. After a lengthy struggle, Prince Octavius-Maximilian XXVXIIIXVXIIVXIXIIVXI emerges victorious. Destinee is carried away on horse as Jean-Baptiste–Pierre-Marie de la Rochefoucauld-d’Aubigny dies a glorious death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue &lt;em&gt;My Ladye Nevells Booke, IWB 162: XV. The Galliarde to the Same&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Equilibrium Girl</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/equilibrium/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/equilibrium/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/equilibrium/ -&lt;p&gt;When she got to college, she gained some weight. Lost some weight. Hated some people. Loved some people. Wished for death. Wished for life. But overall, she lived so that things would average out, and she could maintain, let’s say, some sort of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found friends worth her time. With them, she celebrated birthdays, visited tertiary people, danced at concerts. Crowded places are nice that way; you can forget a lot if you let yourself. Individuals blur into a larger mass, but if you were floating, looking down from above, you would understand that the crowd was less than the individual. She joined those crowds without much hesitation. When the speakers reverberated and the pandemonium belied her heart, it distracted her for a moment. Her friends would find her in the crowd and yell, &lt;em&gt;let’s dance!&lt;/em&gt; She yelled something back. It was difficult sober, but she could fall in love with vanity as long as there was enough alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the dinners with them—she enjoyed those as well. Besides the handful of idiots who invariably wriggled their way into the group, she loved her friends—truly. They cooked shitty meals together. She enjoyed the company more than the food. Once—after all the alcohol and dinner—she lay on the rug, drowsy, listening to her friends sing noughties pop through the smoke-muffled air. This made her feel happy, briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tame her lust, she found a male friend; he was tall with an ugly face. There was something wrong with his nose—too wide, studded with too many pores—so she tried not to look at it. They tasted each other on the ancient couch. Fucked. He smelled odd, but she ignored it. She knew it wouldn’t last long anyway. It didn’t. But at the time, she figured it would take her mind off things. It did for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, after her friends left and abandoned a consuming silence that seeped into the corners of her room, she lay curled up in bed, under the armor of her own warmth, hidden from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, she walked along the horizon of a sunset—a beach without a name. The sun expelled its dying rays on thin clouds imbued with golden mauve hues. The sky glowed in her eyes, her face, the calm sea. Powerless waves washed small bubbles onto the sand. The next wave took them away. She looked for some end, some beginning, some gateway leading someplace else—just not here. And sometimes, she found it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small, lonely cabin ensconced in soft snow. Sitting in front of a crackling wood-burning fireplace—applewood because it smells faintly sweet. She felt warm in a way she could feel through cashmere against her chest. Warm from the chin on her shoulder. Warm from the shared whispers. Warm from intertwined fingers—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the sunset. That’s where she really was. The wind blew her clothes taut and her hair whipped her pretty face. Near the water, some kids played a game without rules. Their parents called them back: &lt;em&gt;time to go home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, that’s it. I’d like to go home&lt;/em&gt;, she thought.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Palindrome Woman and My Bladder</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/palindrome/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/palindrome/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/palindrome/ -&lt;p&gt;Most people, I think, feel divorced from their past as long as enough time passes. Of course, not every piece of their identity is severed, but some parts are, and among them, I suspect embarrassing memories are the first to go. Whether these memories contribute to your identity at the present moment is beside the point. They once belonged to you, and with the passage of time, they drifted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is the story of when I peed my pants in grade school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palindrome woman was my teacher; I call her that because her surname was a palindrome. She was in her late twenties—but that’s probably still her name to this day. She would play songs at the start of each day to &lt;em&gt;get us in the mood for learning&lt;/em&gt; or whatever the fuck that’s supposed to mean because I learnt absolutely nothing. Among her poor selection of songs, “&lt;em&gt;Shake it Off&lt;/em&gt; ” by Swift inevitably made its way into the list. She had been so hooked on the damn song that for a good month or two, it was all she ever played. To this day, I still remember the chorus in embarrassingly great detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we’d all congregate near the door, like a plugged-up dam, waiting for the chime to ring. On this particular day, I had been wanting to visit the washroom for quite some time, but Ms. Shake-it-Off had asked me to wait since school would soon be over. Being the timid child that I was, I didn’t protest, deciding instead to hold it in. But by this point, my bladder had already been stretched taut, approaching maximum capacity, ready to burst at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided it was in my best interest to stand closest to the door where I could rush out of the classroom the fastest. I could also conceal my uncomfortable circumstance among the herd of classmates; I didn’t have friends (they were in another class), so there was no need to worry about an unexpected conversation unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sampling a range of options, I found that crossing my legs and crouching a little relieved the tension. But class had ended unusually early, and there was far too much time left until school ended. After some minutes, as I was approaching my limit, my entire existence served to withhold a vast amount of aqueous output and every ounce of my focus had been directed towards this purpose. I was wallowing in the depths of despair. At some point, amid the confusion of the crowd, some nincompoop bumped into my waist while fooling around with their friends. Your imagination is serving you right. The next moments leave me no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some marginal leakage was inevitable but, I managed to contain it. How, you might ask? I’ll try to make the next couple of sentences as euphemistic as possible: following external trauma to the waist, the chamber reached maximum pressure capacity, exceeding the threshold, expelling a small amount of golden runoff. But thankfully, the male body comes preinstalled with a sort of airlock, or vestibule, following the exit. If you manage to seal off this outer chamber mechanically, you can contain the damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there I was, holding on (literally) for dear life, having prevented the hydration refund. Only a couple of seconds were left on the clock till the chime. The moment of liberation, though it took an eternity, eventually arrived, and as the door opened to reveal the sky, azure; the Victorian clouds belonging to oil sketches; the press-release parents; the dry smell of autumn and tanbark, I let my hand go and ran as fast as I could. But I shouldn’t have let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned a corner to avoid any attention, and as I was sprinting to the nearest washroom, I realized my mistake. Or rather, my mistake realizes itself. The aureate stream is warm and welcoming; the manifestation of liberation. It trickled down my inner thighs as I desperately rushed towards relief. My pants, thankfully, were black, and even though one couldn’t tell by looking, I was most definitely wet from the waist down. I don’t remember how I made it to the washroom, but eventually, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expelled whatever was left in the reserves, resigning myself to the sweet and pungent scent of ammonia rising from below. It was incredibly undignified and shameful, more than anything I’d felt before. After voiding the solution and zipping back up, I wrapped my jacket around my waist to conceal the dark stains. But as I waddled out of the washroom, careful to avoid contact with the residue, a classmate spotted me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks earlier, the school talent show had taken place and she had participated. If I remember correctly, she danced. Hip-hop, I think. My friends and I were all duly impressed and thereafter, she remained an incandescent figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn’t notice the stains, but instead noticed the jacket covering the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why are you wearing your jacket like that?” she asked. It was a genuine question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uhhhh&amp;hellip;” I panic, and in a fit of fear, I managed to form the words, “I don’t know,” shrugging my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have no clue how I got away with that response but she lets me go, somehow. I suspect she knew the truth. Partially relieved, I waddled to the usual pickup spot and reluctantly knocked on the window of my vehicle. My mother pulled the windows down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;「ごめん。おしっこ漏らした。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she looked at me with such shame in her eyes, in utter silence, realizing that she had given birth to a failure. She handed me a towel to keep under my seat, staring at me in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride home was incredibly unpleasant. The interior of the vehicle reeked of piss. I don’t remember much else and I don’t want to either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to forget these embarrassingly hilarious episodes, but I can never seem to outrun them. Not completely. I’m turning twenty this month, which I find odd and foreign regardless of how much I think about it. If you’re twenty and you’ve peed yourself, you understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;em&gt;shake it off,&lt;/em&gt; I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Effort and Yield</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/effort/</link>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/effort/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/effort/ -&lt;p&gt;Exerting too much effort to complete a certain task is not uncommon. This is characteristic, especially of people who are habitually contrarian. Ideally, one exerts the least amount of effort possible to achieve the highest yield possible, but for various reasons, this is difficult to pull off. Hence, knowing, (1) when to exert effort, (2) how much of it to exert, and (3) the way in which it should be exerted, is necessary for optimal exertion. I will attempt an exploration of these three questions, but we must begin by defining effort and its result, which I will refer to as yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-effort&#34;&gt;What is Effort?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effort can simply be defined as the expenditure of energy—physical, mental, or both. Since energy is a limited resource, one should use it sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-yield&#34;&gt;What is Yield?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield is the result of exerting effort. Positive yield produces desirable outcomes; negative yield produces undesirable ones. Yield seems to be a multifaceted sum consisting of tangible benefits that are achieved immediately after the exertion of effort and other components which may include ethical benefits, prospective benefits, and aesthetic benefits. I’m sure there are others I overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since effort and yield have been defined, we can finally discuss the first facet of effort exertion: whether to exert effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exert-effort&#34;&gt;Exert Effort?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question helps determine whether a certain task requires one’s effort—that is, whether one’s effort is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that negative yield is not worth exerting effort for, so we will continue our discussion under the assumption that we are guaranteed positive yield. Take a look at Figure 1 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/effort_vs_yield.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Effort vs Yield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything below the line should be considered a waste of effort, and anything above it should justify effort. One should desire low effort and high yield (above the line). By the same token, high effort and low yield are undesirable (below the line). Our goal is the lower the effort-to-yield ratio as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where one draws the line for making an effort may vary based on one’s values and the anticipated consequences, but the idea should be pretty straightforward. In the subsequent section, I explore the extent of effort exertion and its justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-much-effort-to-exert&#34;&gt;How Much Effort to Exert?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question helps determine whether the amount of effort exerted is proportional to the yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can further divide the plot into four distinct domains of behavior. Take a look Figure 2 below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/categories.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2: Classifications of Behavior Based on Effort and Yield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;intelligent&lt;/strong&gt; person is able to achieve above-par results while investing a low amount of effort. This is the ideal situation to be in. The &lt;strong&gt;hardworking&lt;/strong&gt; person expends more effort to achieve comparable results to the intelligent person. Hardworking people compensate for their lack of talent and intelligence by investing a higher amount of effort into the task. This behavior is often considered a virtue by propriety, though this plot aptly illustrates its drawbacks. The &lt;strong&gt;average&lt;/strong&gt; person achieves disappointing results and, being lazy, also invests little effort. At this point, it should be pretty obvious why &lt;strong&gt;idiocy&lt;/strong&gt; belongs to the corresponding category. Any amount of effort that results in negative yield would also belong in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot does a decent job of illustrating the faults of an inflexible educational system, or really, any kind of bureaucracy. In education, the ultimate goal is learning. From Figure 2, it can be gleaned that being hardworking is not the only way to achieve high yield, or to learn successfully, in the case of education. It would follow that there are other better, more intelligent methods of learning that require less effort from the student. However, educators often fail to question the value of their methods, instead allowing their curricula and attitudes to fall in the hardworking category, or worse, the category of idiocy, requiring students to adopt learning strategies—often assignments—that, in reality, do not help students learn at all, and instead waste time for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the first version of the essay, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.visruth.com/&#34;&gt;Visruth&lt;/a&gt; proposed the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/exponential.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3: Effort and Yield per Effort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He posited that ideally, as one increases effort, the yield per unit of effort should also increase. That is, an increase by one unit of effort at low effort should not give the same yield increase compared to an increase by the same unit of effort far to the right side (high effort). As one increasingly invests effort, a higher rate of yield increase should be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collating these thoughts yields Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/final.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4: Summarized Plot with Classifications of Behavior Proportional to Curve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve explored the idea of how much effort to exert, it’s natural to discuss how it should be exerted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-should-effort-be-invested&#34;&gt;How Should Effort Be Invested?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final question determines how, specifically, effort should be invested to achieve the highest yield possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the highest yield at the lowest cost of effort. When one finds themselves in a high-effort and high-yield scenario (hardworking), attempting to move toward the left category is imperative. One should ask themselves whether there is any method of decreasing effort without impacting yield. Laziness can sometimes be a virtue; lazy people ask themselves this question constantly. The problem is, lazy people also lack discipline by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing one’s approach to a task has the potential to increase yield. In other words, regardless of how much effort is being exerted, as long as one’s methods fail to change, increasing yield is impossibly difficult. One should pivot paths before trying harder. That is, it is important to realize that effort has little bearing on yield.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Girls LOVE Fish</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/fish/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/fish/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/fish/ -&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, I was waddling around my college campus going from one place to the next, with no real destination, as one does. I happened to be behind three guys, fraternity &amp;ldquo;brothers&amp;rdquo; to be precise. For ease of storytelling, let&amp;rsquo;s name them Gunner, Axel, and Thor. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know their names but it&amp;rsquo;s apt and will make do for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone walking past could tell they were real men. Now, Gunner&amp;rsquo;s haircut was a style I imagine one achieves by asking the barber for &amp;ldquo;the bald look&amp;rdquo;, starting at the sides, then leaving halfway through the haircut—just before the razor starts shaving away the top. I believe this style is called a &amp;ldquo;mullet&amp;rdquo;(?). I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask around. In any case, that&amp;rsquo;s going to be my next haircut. Gunner&amp;rsquo;s hair reminded me of a Lego piece that I swear belonged to my Saturn V rocket I was gifted for Christmas at the age of five; the fingerprint of a real man. Axel had a tank top that was more tank than top; he ripped extra material off of it at the arms so that his thick nipples could see the light of day. By the same token, his armpit hair was exposed, glistening with beads of sweat and swaying in the wind, akin to turf after a rowdy football game. It inevitably occurred to me that I want to be like him when I grow up (VSK 2025). Finally, Thor, the manliest of them all, faced derision labeled as a &amp;ldquo;douche&amp;rdquo; though he and I knew that the hatred traced its origins to jealously, held a Monster in one hand and Penny skateboard in the other. He turned towards Gunner and Axel, looking straight into their eyes, preparing to drop what I expected to be the manliest shit I have ever heard. I knew, in this moment compressed between my failed past and my hopeful future, that this was the moment I had lived two decades for. Behind Thor&amp;rsquo;s aviators (even though it was cloudy), I could see the assured salvation. Since they were the manliest of men, I decided to listen intently, for their legendary conversation was about to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I caught some bass last weekend. 24 inches. This one&amp;rsquo;s going on Hinge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world froze for what seemed like an eternity; silence demanded its share of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course! That was the obstacle between me and becoming a man! The implications of the realization were so overwhelming I could hardly contain my excitement. Years of getting rejected by girls now suddenly made sense. I had heard of this stuff in legends, but to be in the presence of these godly men! It was at this moment that I had an epiphany. How could it possibly be any simpler! Surely, my impression was accurate. After all, it came from Gunner, Axel, and Thor; the most credible men when it came to life advice. I had established, or rather, uncovered something legendary; &lt;em&gt;girls fall in love with the guys that catch the biggest fish&lt;/em&gt;. Girls must be swiping left and right, keeping their eyes peeled for guys fondling giant fish. Hell, there&amp;rsquo;s probably a feature on Hinge that allows for filtering based on fish species, size, and weight, all important factors to consider when thinking of entering a serious relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could I climb this newfound rung on the ladder of life? I didn&amp;rsquo;t know a single thing about catching fish. After some failed meditation, I figured that if I joined the ranks of these men, I could somehow diffuse into this heavenly realm myself. I could potentially ask around about fish, which would ensure my entry to the happy life; bliss. I could walk around campus with my arms full of women who understood the true value of a man; fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following week, I decided to rush the fraternity printed on Axel&amp;rsquo;s more-tank-than-top. Oddly, no sight of women. Not a single one within a 10 mile radius of the house, but I assume even real men need time off. I had done some research prior to rushing, and what I had discovered assured me of the truth. Performing simple statistical tests confirmed the trend. The larger the fish, the manlier the man. As I expected, finding a mentor wasn&amp;rsquo;t so hard. He was known among the elites as Brutus, highly regarded as &amp;ldquo;the man&amp;rdquo; of the fraternity. He had claimed his position through his record-breaking streak, successively catching the largest of fish. And consequently, just as the axiom had predicted, he was the manliest of men. His basketball shorts, a physical manifestation of his true greatness, seemed to me an uncoordinated effort at something that I guess would be called an outfit, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a manly man, drowning in attention from women. How could I possibly understand these things. Brutus also smelled of mint and upon closer inspection, I discovered that his front teeth were in fact substituted with Zyn nicotine pouches, supposedly spearmint flavor. I understood this to be the man who would grant me my dreams, and there was absolutely no doubt in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this took place ten years ago. The training process was long and arduous. I&amp;rsquo;ve mastered the art. I&amp;rsquo;m now able to catch the largest of fish without a rod. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me how, I can&amp;rsquo;t go into the details; can&amp;rsquo;t spill all the secrets of the fish. But I guess they recognize my greatness from underwater, so they oblige me by willingly getting caught. My Hinge profile is covered with fish. Girls probably get their daily dose of omega 3 from my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women haven&amp;rsquo;t flocked into my arms just yet. Brutus, who now has no teeth remaining, informed me that there would be a lag phase until my godly powers can be perceived by the masses. But I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that the beginnings of my powers have awakened. The first effects were observed in my grandmother, who I believe, is completely smitten. All the Asian mothers also love me, though now that I think about it, I think this was always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt the credibility of these men, but given the current situation, let us suppose that all else fails. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry my plan is foolproof, but it&amp;rsquo;s always a good idea to expect the worst. I&amp;rsquo;ve only fondled freshwater fish, and my grandmother, who loves me dearly, tells me there&amp;rsquo;s lots of fish in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll try the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my 17 or 35-year-old aunt who inspired this piece. I still don’t know how old she really is.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Japan</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/japan/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/japan/</guid>
        <description>Writing http://localhost:1313/posts/japan/ -&lt;p&gt;The old apartment complexes in Japan are usually brick red, dusty off-white, or plain brown. They only come in these three listless color schemes. You can see them fairly well when taking the train, elevated off the street to save space. Buildings huddle together with just enough space in between for a single thin street. Story after story, door after door of rooms filled with families. It&amp;rsquo;s depressing to see humans relegated to this lifestyle—an overly intricate complex swarming with humans cramming every available hole. Just like a nest full of ants: ants of rudimentary intelligence, completing tasks for the sake of completing them, and living for the sake of being alive. It&amp;rsquo;s a melancholy sight, yet somehow beautiful—like watching nature at work. Like being god. Surely, in those moments, I must have had the eyes of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the trip was spent inside the house with Grandmother. Before I had arrived, she had planned a set of tasks for me to complete, ones she couldn&amp;rsquo;t do by herself. She had asked me to pull the weeds from the backyard. I did not enjoy this. Instead, I made the excuse that it was too hot to work outside, so as any rational being would do, I worked for a mere five minutes and shuffled back into the chilled living room, careful not to be noticed in order to deliver the false impression that I was still busy at work outside. I spread the task of weeding over the entire trip. Grandmother never said anything. By the time I had finished, anybody walking past the house could tell that it was a lazy job. Roots were left in the dirt, heaps of torn grass scattered for the wind to blow, and orphaned bricks were left overturned. I ignored the streaks of sunlight that escaped the wisteria tree to shame my half-hearted effort. When I finally told her I was finished, I could tell she had given up on the prospects of a presentable yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my time in Japan was spent as such, mostly lazing around, absorbing the world rather than living it. I do this to an unwarranted degree: allow myself an exit from my skin and traverse my empty thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this when I was feeding the old woman (a different relative) her soft lukewarm grapes; she&amp;rsquo;s dead now. She mushed the grapes with her half rotten teeth, making sure to push the grapes with her shriveled tongue to the left side of her mouth as she didn&amp;rsquo;t have any teeth remaining on the right. Lying in a fetal position, crushed by her own weight, she told me the grapes tasted cool and sweet though I knew she couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly taste anything in her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an old man who frequented the park across the facility that held her captive. Calling it a park is a bit generous, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what else to call it, so park will do. Jazz bars were his favorite thing in the world, or so I imagined: pique polo shirt, chino pants, a weathered belt, and a fedora. He made it a habit to carry a half-empty box of cigarettes in his breast pocket. He belonged to the park; the park was incomplete without his presence. I understood this very well. The stray cats did too. They seemed somewhat out of place without the old man; he had become a part of their lives. Invariably, they traced the smoke rising from the old man&amp;rsquo;s cigarette in awe, sullen at the sight of its wisps dissolving into the summer sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trip, I finished weeding the entire yard; front and back. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do it for any particular reason. Naturally, no sense of satisfaction came to greet me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the stray cats didn&amp;rsquo;t give it much thought either.&lt;/p&gt;
